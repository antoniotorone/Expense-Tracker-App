##  User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

#### User Goals

1. As a user goal, I want to find an interactive and intuitive interface
2. As a user goal, I want to be able to see my expenses well organized and very visible

### Design

#### Color Scheme

The colour choice for this interface plays very well with the contrast where the background colour of components such as the "add new expense" form has a light violet and the button a rich purple. This creates a good contrast colour for getting the attention of the button the user. The same design strategy can be found for the chart graphic component. The colours are well spread around the interface where the light violet of the form and the graphic recall themselves and also the "add new expense button" recall the expense price.

#### Tipography

The typography choice is the "Noto+Sans+Jp" with a 'normal' font size with '400' of font weight which I assume is enough to explicate the visibility.

### Testing user stories from user experience (UX section)

#### User Goals

1. As a user goal, I want to find an interactive and intuitive interface

   1. The app presents different react components well built for an expense tracker. We find a chart directly connected to the years and anytime the year is switched, the chart change in relation and also the expenses. So the interface is interactive with the presence of a form used for adding a new expense through a button positioned on purpose in the middle of the page directly to attract the visuality of the user and intuitive thanks to the building component order.
   
2. As a user goal, I want to be able to see my expenses well organized and very visible

   1. The components that display the expenses are well organized because divided by date, name and price; also the font size and the colour contrast help the user visibility.
